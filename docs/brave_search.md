## Query Parameters

This table lists the query parameters supported by the Web Search API. Some are required, but
most are optional.

| Parameter | Required | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| q | true | string |  | The user’s search query term. Query can not be empty. Maximum of 400 characters and 50 words in the query. |
| country | false | string | US | The search query country, where the results come from.<br>The country string is limited to 2 character country codes<br>of supported countries. For a list of supported values,<br>see [Country Codes](https://api-dashboard.search.brave.com/app/documentation/web-search/codes#country-codes). |
| search\_lang | false | string | en | The search language preference.<br>The 2 or more character language code for which the search<br>results are provided. For a list of possible values, see<br>[Language Codes](https://api-dashboard.search.brave.com/app/documentation/web-search/codes#language-codes). |
| ui\_lang | false | string | en-US | User interface language preferred in response.<br>Usually of the format `<language_code>-<country_code>`. For more,<br>see [RFC 9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-accept-language).<br>For a list of supported values, see<br>[UI Language Codes](https://api-dashboard.search.brave.com/app/documentation/web-search/codes#market-codes). |
| count | false | int | 20 | The number of search results returned in response.<br>The maximum is `20`. The actual number delivered may be less<br>than requested. Combine this parameter with `offset` to<br>paginate search results.<br>**NOTE**: Count only applies to `web` results. |
| offset | false | int | 0 | The zero based offset that indicates number of search<br>results per page (count) to skip before returning the result.<br>The maximum is `9`. The actual number delivered may be less<br>than requested based on the query.<br>In order to paginate results use this parameter together<br>with `count`. For example, if your user interface displays<br>20 search results per page, set `count` to `20` and offset to<br>`0` to show the first page of results. To get subsequent pages,<br>increment `offset` by 1 (e.g. 0, 1, 2). The results may<br>overlap across multiple pages. |
| safesearch | false | string | moderate | Filters search results for adult content.<br>The following values are supported:<br>- `off`: No filtering is done.<br>  <br>- `moderate`: Filters explicit content, like images and<br>videos, but allows adult domains in the search results.<br>  <br>- `strict`: Drops all adult content from search results. |
| freshness | false | string |  | Filters search results by when they were discovered.<br>The following values are supported:<br>- `pd`: Discovered within the last 24 hours.<br>  <br>- `pw`: Discovered within the last 7 Days.<br>  <br>- `pm`: Discovered within the last 31 Days.<br>  <br>- `py`: Discovered within the last 365 Days.<br>  <br>- `YYYY-MM-DDtoYYYY-MM-DD`: timeframe is also supported by specifying<br>the date range e.g. `2022-04-01to2022-07-30`. |
| text\_decorations | false | bool | true | Whether display strings (e.g. result snippets) should<br>include decoration markers (e.g. highlighting characters). |
| spellcheck | false | bool | true | Whether to spellcheck provided query. If the spellchecker<br>is enabled, the modified query is always used for search.<br>The modified query can be found in `altered` key from the<br>[query](https://api-dashboard.search.brave.com/app/documentation/web-search/responses#Query) response model. |
| result\_filter | false | string |  | A comma delimited string of result types to include in the<br>search response.<br>Not specifying this parameter will return back all result types<br>in search response where data is available and a plan with the<br>corresponding option is subscribed. The response always includes<br>query and type to identify any query modifications and response<br>type respectively.<br>Available result filter values are:<br>- `discussions`<br>  <br>- `faq`<br>  <br>- `infobox`<br>  <br>- `news`<br>  <br>- `query`<br>  <br>- `summarizer`<br>  <br>- `videos`<br>  <br>- `web`<br>  <br>- `locations`<br>  <br>Example result filter param `result_filter=discussions`, `videos`<br>returns only `discussions`, and videos responses. Another<br>example where only location results are required, set the<br>`result_filter` param to `result_filter=locations`.<br>**NOTE**: `count` only applies to `web` results. |
