# Brave Web Search API

## Introduction

Brave Web Search API is a REST API to query Brave Search
and get back search results from the web. The following
sections describe how to curate requests, including parameters
and headers, to Brave Web Search API and get a JSON response back.

> To try the API on a Free plan, you’ll still need to subscribe — you
> simply won’t be charged. Once subscribed, you can get an API key
> in the [API Keys section](https://api-dashboard.search.brave.com/app/keys).

## Endpoints

Brave Search API exposes multiple endpoints for specific types
of data, based on the level of your subscription. If you don’t
see the endpoint you’re interested in, you may need to change
your subscription.

```

# Brave Local Search API

## Introduction

Brave Local Search API provides enrichments for location search results.

> Access to Local API is available through the [Pro plans](https://api-dashboard.search.brave.com/app/subscriptions/subscribe?tab=normal).

## Endpoints

Brave Local Search API is currently available at the following
endpoints and exposes an API to get extra information about a
location, including pictures and related web results.

```
https://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/local/pois


```

The endpoint supports batching and retrieval of extra information
of up to 20 locations with a single request.

The local API also includes an endpoint to get an AI generated
description for a location.

```
https://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/local/descriptions


```

## Example

An initial request has to be made to web search endpoint with
a given query. An example CURL request is given below.

```

curl -s --compressed "https://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/web/search?q=greek+restaurants+in+san+francisco" \
  -H "Accept: application/json" \
  -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip" \
  -H "X-Subscription-Token: $BRAVE_API_KEY"


```

If the query returns a list of locations, as in this case, each location
result has an [id field](https://api-dashboard.search.brave.com/app/documentation/web-search/responses#LocationResult),
which is a temporary ID that can be used to retrieve extra information about the
location. An example from the locations result is given below.

```
{
  "locations": {
    "results": [\
      {\
        "id": "1520066f3f39496780c5931d9f7b26a6",\
        "title": "Pangea Banquet Mediterranean Food"\
      },\
      {\
        "id": "d00b153c719a427ea515f9eacf4853a2",\
        "title": "Park Mediterranean Grill"\
      },\
      {\
        "id": "4b943b378725432aa29f019def0f0154",\
        "title": "The Halal Mediterranean Co."\
      }\
    ]
  }
}


```

The `id` value can be used to further fetch extra information
about the location. An example request is given below.

```

curl -s --compressed "https://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/local/pois?ids=1520066f3f39496780c5931d9f7b26a6&ids=d00b153c719a427ea515f9eacf4853a2" \
  -H "accept: application/json" \
  -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip" \
  -H "x-subscription-token: $BRAVE_API_KEY"


```

An AI generated description associated with a location
can be further fetched using the example below.

```

curl -s --compressed "https://api.search.brave.com/res/v1/local/descriptions?ids=1520066f3f39496780c5931d9f7b26a6&ids=d00b153c719a427ea515f9eacf4853a2" \
  -H "accept: application/json" \
  -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip" \
  -H "x-subscription-token: $BRAVE_API_KEY"


```
